Hibernate-EHCache

if cache strategy is read only then we cannot perform update operation
if try will get the below error

	java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Can't write to a readonly object 
	
	Note : using hibernate we cannot apply the multiple cache strategies on the entity,
	 because @Cache is not a @Repeatable annotation
	
Cache strategies:

	READ_ONLY
	READ_WRITE
	NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE
